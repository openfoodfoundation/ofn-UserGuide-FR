# Tarification spécifique par acheteurs

Sometimes our users want to charge different prices for different customers, often based on their member Vs non-member status.Currently, there’s no way to automatically charge different prices for members vs non-members, but there are some round about ways of achieving the same thing.

* Depending on what shipping methods you plan to have, you can create a ‘member shipping method’ which may have a 30% mark-up, and a ‘non-member shipping method’ which might have a 50% markup. This will require you to check that the customer has selected the correct one at checkout.
* If your payment method is cash upon collection, you can add the markup, or a ‘non-member’ fee after their order is placed, and add it to their invoice for when they collect their order and pay. You just need to make sure that your customers are aware of this process, which can be done in the ‘shopfront message’.
* You could also create two order cycles, one for members and one for non-members. In the one for non-members you can apply an enterprise fee that’s higher. Again, you need to check that non-members have shopped in the correct order cycle with the higher markups.

There’s also the capacity to add ‘tags’ to customers. This is a way to flag your ‘member’ customers, and this info carries into the OFN reports, so you can easily see who is tagged as a member and who is not.
